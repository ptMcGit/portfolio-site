<p class="prose">
  When I graduated from college I had hoped to work as a camera person in the film industry, but I left those ambitions behind to work for a small business out in California.

  Life at the chocolate factory was sweet, but I decided to leave in pursuit of different challenges. A year later I found myself working on a Linux server, and doing a lot of scripting in bash. My passion for documentation, small-business, and artistic inclination has led me to web development.
</p>

<p class="prose">
  To further my education in this area I completed a 12-week intensive Ruby on Rails Back End Engineering course at the Iron Yard in Durham, NC, in the summer of 2016. I am also pursuing an associate's degree in web development.
</p>

<p class="prose">
  Iâ€™d like to find work in development operations or as a web developer, but I am very willing to branch out and eager to learn as much as I can. I feel that my experience working for a small business and passion make me an asset to any forward-thinking small business whose employees are hard-working and believe in what they are doing.

<p class="prose">
  I enjoy playing/writing music, photography, and getting outdoors when not at work.
