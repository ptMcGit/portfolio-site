    A few years ago, I quit my job as quality assurance manager at a food manufacturer. I needed a career change, and wanted to continue to grow.
  </p>

  <p class="prose">
    I got into software and web development, becuase I believe in the power of these tools to solve big and interesting problems. I find the work in this area challenging, creative, and fun.
  </p>

  <p class="prose">
    Since the beginning, I have been working towards finding the right tools, and building up my skillset. I prefer to work in a Linux server environmentâ€”I'm curently using Ubuntu. And, I have made a concerted effort to adopt and learn many of the available tools e.g. sed, gawk, SSH, sudo, gpg, etc. I feel very much at home in a bash terminal, and hope to add Python to the mix soon.
  </p>

  <p class="prose">
    One of my long-term goals is to adopt tools that are fairly future-proof, modular, and extensible. The aspect of extensibility makes tools like emacs attractive. I'm slowly picking up Docker as a means to create a more modular environment, and Ansible as a means to make configuration a breeze.
  </p>

  <p class="prose">
    I'm not just a tools/systems guy. I'm also interested and shoring up my knowledge in math and science. I've taken some time to apply myself to logic, math, and heavier computer science material. And hopefully, the headier concepts of computer science will someday be accessible to me.
  </p>

  <p class="prose">
    Documentation is very important to me, and I feel it's an important part of self-improvement. This is part of the reason I've gotten into web development. There is also the presentational side, which given my artistic background, is a nice diversion from some of the drier work.

  <p class="prose">
    I am currently pursuing an associate's degree in web development so I can become a better web developer. I recently completed the 12-week intensive Ruby on Rails Back End Engineering course at Iron Yard in Durham, NC. We started with the Ruby language and worked our way towards Ruby on Rails. The folks at the Iron Yard do their best to simulate a production environment. We worked in groups for many projects. In some cases this meant working with non-Rails developers. I feel that the whole experience has made me a much better team-member and developer, and that now have a better sense of the web ecosystem and the tools available to developers.

    I can confidently say that I am able to build a web application using Ruby on Rails and deploy it using heroku, and much more.
