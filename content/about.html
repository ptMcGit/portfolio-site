title: About
---

<p>After some time in the art studio, the basement (that's where we jam), and at work, I decided to pursue a degree in film studies. I spent a lot of time beside the camera and immersed in motion graphics during my time at UNCW.</p>
<p>
  In 2011, I joined Helen Grace Chocolates, resigning as quality assurance manager in 2015. Since that time I have been studying web development and devops.</p>

<p>I enjoy photography, playing/writing music, and getting outdoors.</p>
