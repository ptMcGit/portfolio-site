<p>After some time in the art studio, the basement (that's where we liked to jam), and at work, I decided to go to UNCW to study film. During that time I was usally  beside the camera or immersed in motion graphics. I really miss working with film stock.</p>
<p>
  In 2011, I joined Helen Grace Chocolates, resigning as quality assurance manager in 2014. Since that time I have been studying web development and devops.</p>

<p>I enjoy playing/writing music, photography, and getting outdoors.</p>
